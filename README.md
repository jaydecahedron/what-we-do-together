Aurora files for creating your own Creature of the Night from my What We Do In The Shadows inspired Dungeons and Dragons 5e homebrew campaign.

I am learning the aurora code format while working on this so some things may be broken as I work on creating files for easy access for my players. 

As with any Aurora homebrew file, you'll want to unzip the downloaded files and upload to your /custom/user folder most likely found in my Documents folder for Aurora 5e Builder.

Should you need to download Aurora, you can download the file from this link: https://aurorabuilder.com/get-started/

You can find the creator's patreon here: https://www.patreon.com/aurorabuilder/
